# Binary-Tree

Always you can solve using recursion.

preorder ->stack+recursive approach

left view binary tree-> inorder traversal left root right

right view binary tree -> right root left traversal

bottom view ->level order traversal

use boundary conditions in fuction to stop,like maximum value it can visit upto ans minimum value it can go upto.
